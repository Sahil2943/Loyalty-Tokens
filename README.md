### Objectives :

1. The key objective is to simplify the process of earning and redeeming rewards.
2. To enhance the security and privacy of customer data.
3. To create a tamper-proof and trustworthy record of transactions, improving the overall efficiency of the loyalty program ecosystem.
4. To use blockchain-based rewards as incentives to encourage specific customer behaviors, such as repeat purchases, referrals, and social engagement
5. The Loyalty Tokens should be decaying in nature, in that, after a certain period their use for the redemption of benefits offered by the brand/retailer will expire.
6. GUI-based tool that doesn’t require knowledge of any Blockchain programming to use by Brands and Retailers.

### Solution Proposed :

Implemented a ERC-20 smart contract on the blockchain that can create and manage fungible tokens representing loyalty points.

**1. Fungible Loyalty Token Issuance:**
- When a user makes a purchase, they will be eligible to receive fungible Loyalty Tokens.
- The issuance will include details such as the date of token issuance and the amount of tokens received by the user.

**2. Token Usage for Exclusive Offers:**
- Users can utilize the received Loyalty Tokens to redeem exclusive deals and offers offered by the loyalty program.
- The loyalty program will provide a platform for users to explore and select the available deals and offers for redemption.
- Multiple earning avenues, including referrals, challenges, and more, will empower users to earn additional loyalty tokens.

**3. Retailer and Seller Involvement:**

- Retailers and sellers participating in the program will have the capability to reward their customers with Loyalty Tokens.
- These tokens can serve as rewards for demonstrating loyalty to their brand or for achieving certain milestones.

**4. Token Decay and Expiry:**
- The Loyalty Tokens will have a decaying nature, meaning they will expire after a predetermined period of time.
- Tokens will carry an expiration date, and any unused tokens will automatically expire once the specified time has elapsed.
